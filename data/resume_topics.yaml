ml_basics:
  keywords: ["what is machine learning", "machine learning", "ml", "why is it important", "importance"]
  bullets:
    - "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with fixed rules."
    - "A model is trained on historical data to map inputs to outputs; once trained, it can generalize to new, unseen data."
    - "Machine learning is important because it lets us automate complex decisions at scale – from recommendations and anomaly detection to forecasting and personalization."
    - "In MLOps, understanding these basics is crucial because our pipelines, monitoring and retraining strategies are all built around how models learn and drift over time."
